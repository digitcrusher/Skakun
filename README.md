# Goals
- Modal editing with multiple selections and emphasis on visual feedback and discoverability (Kakoune-style)
- Optimized for editing huge files
- Not just a code editor - support for binary files
- Let the user modify every behavior with Lua (Lite-or-Emacs-style)
- Make the most out of the terminal
